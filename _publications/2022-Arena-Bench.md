title: "Sequence-Defined Pareto Frontier of A Copolymer Structure"

The correlations between the sequence of monomers in a macromolecule and its three-dimensional (3D) structure is a grand challenge in polymer science. The properties and functions of macromolecules depend on their 3D shape that has appeared to be dictated by their monomer sequence. However, the progress towards understanding the sequenceâ€“structure-property correlations and their utilization in materials engineering are slow because it is almost impossible to characterize an astronomically large number of possible sequences of a copolymer using traditional experimental and simulation methods. To address this problem, here, we combine evolutionary computing and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation and study the sequence-structure correlations of a model AB-type copolymer in a solution and assess the impact of sequence on the packing density in its bulk phase. The CGMD-based evolutionary algorithm (EA) screens the sequence space of a single chain copolymer efficiently and identifies a wide range of single-molecule structures including extremal radii of gyration. The data are utilized to estimate the Pareto front of the structure-space of a binary copolymer as a function of its composition. The monomer packings in single-molecule solution phase and multimolecular bulk phase are found to be identical. The work highlights the opportunities of sequence-specific control of macromolecular structure for designing target materials.
