collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-Arena-Bench
excerpt: 'The ability to autonomously navigate safely, especially within dynamic environments, is paramount for mobile robotics. In recent years, DRL approaches have shown superior performance in dynamic obstacle avoidance. However, these learning-based approaches are often developed in specially designed simulation environments and are hard to test against conventional planning approaches. Furthermore, the integration and deployment of these approaches into real robotic platforms are not yet completely solved. In this paper, we present Arena-bench, a benchmark suite to train, test, and evaluate navigation planners on different robotic platforms within 3D environments. It provides tools to design and generate highly dynamic evaluation worlds, scenarios, and tasks for autonomous navigation and is fully integrated into the robot operating system. To demonstrate the functionalities of our suite, we trained a DRL agent on our platform and compared it against a variety of existing different model-based and learning-based navigation approaches on a variety of relevant metrics. Finally, we deployed the approaches towards real robots and demonstrated the reproducibility of the results.'

title: "Sequence-Defined Pareto Frontier of A Copolymer Structure"

The correlations between the sequence of monomers in a macromolecule and its three-dimensional (3D) structure is a grand challenge in polymer science. The properties and functions of macromolecules depend on their 3D shape that has appeared to be dictated by their monomer sequence. However, the progress towards understanding the sequenceâ€“structure-property correlations and their utilization in materials engineering are slow because it is almost impossible to characterize an astronomically large number of possible sequences of a copolymer using traditional experimental and simulation methods. To address this problem, here, we combine evolutionary computing and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation and study the sequence-structure correlations of a model AB-type copolymer in a solution and assess the impact of sequence on the packing density in its bulk phase. The CGMD-based evolutionary algorithm (EA) screens the sequence space of a single chain copolymer efficiently and identifies a wide range of single-molecule structures including extremal radii of gyration. The data are utilized to estimate the Pareto front of the structure-space of a binary copolymer as a function of its composition. The monomer packings in single-molecule solution phase and multimolecular bulk phase are found to be identical. The work highlights the opportunities of sequence-specific control of macromolecular structure for designing target materials.
